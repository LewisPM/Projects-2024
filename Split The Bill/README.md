# Split the Bill


## About:

A program which provides instructions on how to split the bill. The program receives the following inputs, line by line from a file (whose name is provided by the user via the console):

* _The total of their bill (double)_
* _A space (char)_
* _The full name of the diner (string)_

Project parameters originate from an NYU Bridge Course assignment.

## Implementation:

* We will use a 'Diner' class which stores the name of the diner and the total of their bill.
_The diner would be representative of a node._
* The program reads all the inputs from the file, storing the whole name and total amoun into a linked list.
_We will take care when collecting the information, keeping in mind C++ space handling._
_A Custom node and Linked-List class is required for this assignment._
* The program outputs who should give what amount of money and to whom.
_The 'amount to give' is based on splitting the total evenly. The difference from what the individual paid to what is owed, is divied so that all individuals have the same amount._
* We run on the assumption that the file is formatted correctly and contains all necessary infomration.
