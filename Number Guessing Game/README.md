# Number Guessing Game


## About:

A Number Guessing Game where the program randomly chooses an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the user trys to guess that number.

Project parameters originated from an assignment with the NYU Bridge Course.

## Implementation:

* The user has 5 chances to guess the number. Before each guess the program announces an updated guessing range, taking the previous responses in account, and the number of guesses the user has left. 
* If the user guesses correctly, the program announcves how many guesses the user used.
* If the user guesses wrong and it is not the fifth time, the program will consult the user on whether they should guess higher or lower.
* If the user guesses wrong and it is the fifth time, the program will reveal the number it chose.
