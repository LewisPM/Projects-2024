            <p>In the mid 18th century, the Erie Canal was completed and lead to an economic boom by increasing the connectivity of various settlements. 
               As the anti-slavery movement grew, Buffalo became a gathering place for Abolitionists and was a terminus point on the Underground Railroad.

            <p>Buffalo was an industrial town prospering from manufacturing and grain production.  
                Resistance to modernization lead to a decline, losing 70,000 jobs between 1970 and 1984.
                Economic recovery from deinsurtialization was a focus for Buffalo in the late 20th century.
