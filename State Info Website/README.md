# State Informational Website


## About:

A multipage website that covers the details of a chosen state. My state of choice is New York.

Project parameters originate from a WGU Course assignment.

## Implementation:

* We developed a simple wireframe with two templates, one for the state/ home page and another for the city.
* We used semantic HTML to create the pages, CSS to design the pages and JavaScript to add some interactivity to the pages.
* Additionaly, we added some Bootstrap and REACT for practice sake.
* The website is hosted on infinityfree: stateinformational.free.nf

VSCode (V1.86.0)
