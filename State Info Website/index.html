            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>New York State was one of the original Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States.
                Initially it was inhabited by Native Americans for thousands of years. The Dutch established a multiethnic colony in 1621. 
                After, it was initially seized by England from the Dutch in 1664, naming it the Province of New York. 
                Many battles happend on the soil of New York during the American Revolution (approximately one third of all battles).

            </p>
            <p>From the late 18th to the late 19th century, New York started to look as it does today. 
                The Erie Canal lead to an economic boom by increasing the connectivity of various settlements. 
                Many notable companys also started around this time such as American Express, Chase, At&T, IBM, Pfizer, Macy's, General Electric, Goldman Sachs and others.
                New York City was the largest port of entry for legal immigration. Ellis Island was opened January 1st 1892 and stopped immigration processing November 12th 1954.
            </p>
            <aside>
                More than 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954. 
                More than 100 million Americans across the United States can trace their ancestry to these immigrants.
