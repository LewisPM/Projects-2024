# Checkbook Balancing


## About:

A checkbook balancing program. The program receives the following inputs via the console for all checks that were not cashed since the last checkbook balance:

* _The number of each check (integer)_
* _The amount of the check (double)_
* _Whether the check was cashed or not (boolean)_

Project parameters originate from an NYU Bridge Course assignment.

## Implementation:

* We will use a 'Check' class array to record the checks.
* The program reads all the deposits from the console, the old and the new account balance.
* The program outputs the total of the checks cashed, the total of the deposits, what the new balance is, and how much this figure differs from the new balance provided by the user.
* It also outputs two lists of checks, the checks cashed since the last time the checkbook was balanced and the checks still not cashed.
* Extra credit: Display both lists in sorted by Check number from lowest to highest.
