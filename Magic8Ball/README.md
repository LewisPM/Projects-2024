# Magic 8 Ball in Python


## About:

A Magic 8 Ball Python Program that accepts one question and outputs a fortune.

## Project Objectives:

* Write a magic8.py Python program that can answer any “Yes” or “No” question with a different fortune each time it executes.

### Additionally I wanted to add the following features:
* Accept input for the name and question.
* Check the input for the name and question.
* Allow another question to be asked after a fortune is given.

VSCode (V1.86.0)
Node.js (18.17.1)
